Assignment: JDBC and Database Connectivity

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to create a Java application that demonstrates the use of JDBC for connecting to a MySQL database and provides an overview of NoSQL databases. Learners will implement database connectivity using JDBC for a MySQL database and explore the concepts of NoSQL databases.

Setting Up and Running the Java Application:

Clone the Repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash

Copy code

cd <project_directory>

Set Up MySQL Database:

Install MySQL if not already installed.

Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the Java application.

Import Project into IntelliJ IDEA:

Open IntelliJ IDEA.

Select "File" > "Open" and navigate to the project directory.

Select the project directory and click "Open" to import the project.

Run the Application:

Locate the main class of your Java application.

Right-click on the main class and select "Run" to execute the application.

Overview of NoSQL Databases:

Introduction to NoSQL:

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that provide a flexible schema and are designed for scalability and performance.

Key Characteristics:

NoSQL databases often offer high availability, horizontal scalability, and support for unstructured or semi-structured data.

Advantages over SQL Databases:

NoSQL databases excel in scenarios requiring scalability, flexibility, and handling of large volumes of data, which traditional SQL databases may struggle with.

Types of NoSQL Databases:

Document-Oriented: Examples include MongoDB, Couchbase.

Key-Value: Examples include Redis, DynamoDB.

Column-Family: Examples include Cassandra, HBase.

Graph Databases: Examples include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

Use Cases:

NoSQL databases are suitable for applications requiring real-time analytics, content management systems, and applications with rapidly evolving schemas.

Examples of Popular NoSQL Databases:

MongoDB: Document-oriented database known for its flexibility and scalability.

Cassandra: Column-family database designed for high availability and linear scalability.

Redis: Key-value store with support for various data structures and caching capabilities.
